## ***Exercise 10.3: Create a platform product roadmap blueprint for epetech.online***

Objective: The objective of this exercise is to think about how epetech.online would create a platform product roadmap. Remember, you are not creating the roadmap itself as that would require understanding of the domain specific activities of epetech. 

Recommended Steps: In order ot achieve this objective, we recommend the following steps 

1. What are the teams and types of requirements analysis you will be doing if you are createing a platform product roadmap (Hint: Conduct stakeholder management)?  
2. What are the strategic goals for the overall business that will be addressed by the platform product capabilities being built?  
3. What are the communication tools you will need to use to increase trust among your stakeholders on the progress of the platform capability buildout

### **Solution**

The roadmap blueprint provides a structured approach for Epetech.online to align platform engineering efforts with strategic business goals, stakeholder expectations, and transparent communication. This ensures the platform evolves intentionally and sustainably, rather than reactively.

### 1. Teams & Requirements Analysis
To build an effective roadmap, it’s essential to engage diverse stakeholders and capture both technical and business requirements:

- **Internal Developers & Engineering Teams**  
  - Needs: Faster deployments, reliable CI/CD pipelines, improved observability, and self-service capabilities.  
  - Method: Developer surveys, sprint retrospectives, platform usability tests.  

- **Business & Product Stakeholders**  
  - Needs: Faster time-to-market, compliance adherence, reliability for end-users, and cost efficiency.  
  - Method: Workshops, quarterly alignment sessions, business value mapping.  

- **Security & Compliance Teams**  
  - Needs: Secure defaults, audit trails, compliance-by-design.  
  - Method: Risk assessments, policy reviews, regulatory mapping.  

- **External Partners & API Consumers**  
  - Needs: API usability, clear documentation, predictable SLAs, and reliable integration patterns.  
  - Method: Advisory groups, interviews, feedback from developer forums.  

**Approach:** Conduct structured stakeholder management by categorizing requirements into *must-have*, *should-have*, and *long-term strategic* buckets.

### 2. Strategic Goals Addressed by Platform Capabilities
The roadmap should explicitly tie platform initiatives to business outcomes. For Epetech.online, potential goals include:

- **Accelerate Time-to-Market**  
  - Deliver features faster by reducing lead times and automating platform workflows.  

- **Improve Developer Experience (DevEx)**  
  - Enhance onboarding, reduce cognitive load, and provide golden paths to boost productivity.  

- **Ensure Reliability and Security**  
  - Bake in SRE practices, monitoring, and compliance automation to meet customer expectations.  

- **Optimize Cost and Resource Utilization**  
  - Implement observability-driven insights and scaling strategies to control infrastructure spend.  

- **Enable Ecosystem Growth**  
  - Provide robust APIs, documentation, and partner enablement to expand Epetech’s ecosystem.  

### 3. Communication Tools for Trust & Transparency
To gain and maintain stakeholder trust, Epetech must establish clear and consistent communication channels:

- **Platform Roadmap Dashboards**  
  - Use tools like Jira, Trello, or Aha! to provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into progress.  

- **Quarterly Roadmap Reviews**  
  - Present updates in structured sessions with executives, product teams, and developer representatives.  

- **Developer Portal & Knowledge Base**  
  - Share updates, changelogs, and upcoming features through a centralized portal.  

- **Community Forums & Advisory Groups**  
  - Create two-way communication channels for real-time feedback and discussions.  

- **Internal Newsletters / Slack Updates**  
  - Provide bite-sized updates to build confidence and transparency across the organization.  

### Intended Outcome
By following this roadmap blueprint, **Epetech.online** will:  
- Align platform development with business strategy.  
- Engage stakeholders early to capture diverse requirements.  
- Demonstrate progress transparently to build trust.  
- Evolve the platform in a structured, value-driven manner rather than through ad hoc initiatives.
