## ***Exercise 10.2: Create an approach for a feedback mechanism at Epetech.online***

Objective**:** Implement a feedback mechanism to gather qualitative and quantitative insights from internal developers, third-party developers, and partners regarding the usability, performance, and challenges of using epetech's API services.

Recommended steps:

1. Provide the steps for setting up a Surveys & Interviews process as shown in the PETech case above  
2. How would you form a Platform Team responsible for feedback analysis  
3. Based on the example provided above, how would you create community forums for discussions  
4. Should you be forming Advisory Groups for Strategic Feedback

#### Intended outcome:

By implementing this simple feedback mechanism, epetech should be able to continuously improve its developer platform, ensuring both internal and external stakeholders are satisfied with the usability and performance of their APIs. 

### **Solution**

### Approach for a Feedback Mechanism at Epetech.online

To ensure continuous improvement of Epetech's API services and overall platform usability, we propose a multi-pronged feedback approach that combines **surveys, interviews, forums, and advisory groups**. This approach captures both qualitative and quantitative insights from developers and partners.


### 1. Surveys & Interviews
- **Surveys**:  
  - Launch periodic (quarterly) surveys targeting internal developers, external partners, and third-party developers.  
  - Focus areas: API usability, performance, documentation clarity, error handling, and developer experience.  
  - Use lightweight tools such as Google Forms, Typeform, or integrated developer portal surveys.  
- **Interviews**:  
  - Conduct structured interviews with a rotating set of developers from different teams.  
  - Encourage open feedback by keeping discussions informal but guided by predefined themes (e.g., onboarding friction, API error patterns).  
  - Capture both pain points and success stories to guide platform improvements.

### 2. Platform Team for Feedback Analysis
- Form a **dedicated Feedback & Insights squad** within the Epetech platform team.  
- Responsibilities:  
  - Collect and analyze survey results and interview data.  
  - Identify recurring themes and categorize feedback into quick fixes vs. long-term roadmap items.  
  - Share monthly insights with the broader platform engineering team and leadership.  
  - Close the loop with developers by communicating actions taken on their feedback.  

### 3. Community Forums
- Create **developer community forums** to foster engineer-to-engineer support and open discussions.  
  - Options: Discourse, GitHub Discussions, or Slack/Discord channels.  
  - Moderate forums to ensure constructive feedback and timely responses from the Epetech team.  
  - Use forums as a living knowledge base where FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and feature announcements are posted.  
- Benefits:  
  - Encourages transparent communication.  
  - Allows developers to self-serve answers while surfacing systemic issues to the platform team.  

### 4. Advisory Groups for Strategic Feedback
- Establish **Developer Advisory Groups** with representatives from:  
  - Internal development teams.  
  - Key external partners.  
  - Strategic third-party integrators.  
- Purpose:  
  - Provide deeper insights on long-term product direction.  
  - Validate strategic decisions on API evolution, roadmap priorities, and platform improvements.  
  - Meet quarterly to discuss trends, challenges, and opportunities.  

### Intended Outcome
By implementing this feedback mechanism, **Epetech.online** will:  
- Gather continuous input from its developer ecosystem.  
- Prioritize improvements that directly enhance developer experience.  
- Build stronger relationships with internal and external stakeholders.  
- Evolve the platform strategically, backed by both data and developer community insights.
