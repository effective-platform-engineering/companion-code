# Exercise 10.4: Adopting a Platform-as-a-Product Mindset

## Objective
Develop a product vision and roadmap for your internal platform, incorporating user-centric design principles.

## Recommended Steps

1. **Conduct User Research**
   - *Coding Activity*: Build a survey application using a web framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Express.js).  
     Collect responses and store them in a database such as SQLite or MongoDB.  
   - *Data Analysis*: Write scripts in Python or R to analyze survey data and extract critical insights.

2. **Define the Platform's Vision and Mission**
   - Summarize findings from your analysis.  
   - Craft clear and concise **vision** and **mission** statements.

3. **Develop a Product Roadmap**
   - *Modeling Activity*: Use project management tools like Trello, Jira, or Azure DevOps to create a visual roadmap.  
   - Organize features into sprints or releases.

4. **Create User Personas**
   - *Modeling Activity*: Design personas using visual tools.  
   - Include demographic information, goals, challenges, and preferred tools.

5. **Design a Prototype or Mockup**
   - *Coding Activity*: Develop an interactive prototype of a critical platform feature using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, or Angular.  
   - Alternatively, use tools like Figma for non-coded mockups.

6. **Gather Feedback**
   - Present the prototype to stakeholders and users.  
   - Document feedback, action items, and planned improvements.


## Expected Deliverables
- Platform **Vision and Mission Statements** in documented format.  
- Product Roadmap visualized with project management tools.  
- User Personas with detailed descriptions and visuals.  
- Interactive coded prototype of crucial platform features.  
- Feedback Summary with action items and planned improvements.  

## Solution: Epetech.online

### Vision & Mission
- **Vision**: Create a seamless, self-service developer experience that enables teams to innovate quickly, reliably, and securely.  
- **Mission**: Provide Epetech developers and partners with standardized, automated, and observable platform capabilities that reduce cognitive load and accelerate product delivery.  

### Roadmap Blueprint
- **Near Term (0–3 months)**:  
  - Launch survey app and conduct initial research.  We are not providing an example of the sample js script or the R script. We leave it to the readers on how they want to handle that part.
  - Deliver onboarding improvements and standardized golden paths.  
- **Mid Term (3–6 months)**:  
  - Implement enhanced observability and self-service environment provisioning.  
  - Create detailed user personas and validate them against developer workflows.  
- **Long Term (6–12 months)**:  
  - Roll out intelligent assistants and automation for troubleshooting.  
  - Expand APIs and partner enablement capabilities.  

### User Personas
- **Internal Developer**: Needs faster builds, self-service infra, and reliable CI/CD.  
- **External Partner Developer**: Needs strong API docs, predictable SLAs, and sandbox environments.  
- **Platform SRE**: Needs deep observability, security compliance, and automation.  

### Prototype
- Build a **self-service environment provisioning portal** as the first coded prototype (React + API integration).  
- Demonstrate golden path deployment from code commit → CI → test → deploy.  

### Feedback Loop
- Share prototype with advisory groups and developer forums.  
- Collect qualitative (interviews, feedback sessions) and quantitative (survey results) data.  
- Incorporate insights into roadmap iterations.  

### Intended Outcome
By adopting a **platform-as-a-product mindset**, Epetech.online will:  
- Align platform development with real user needs.  
- Continuously validate product decisions with data.  
- Build trust with developers and partners through transparency and responsiveness.  
- Evolve into a sustainable, value-driven platform that supports both innovation and operational excellence.
