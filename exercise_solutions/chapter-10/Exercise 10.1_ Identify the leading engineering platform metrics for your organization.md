## ***Exercise 10.1: Identify the leading engineering platform metrics for your organization***

Objective**:** While the inventory of the leading metrics you might have in an organization is a finite set, it is important to identify the appropriate leading metrics that would lead you to your DORA metrics (4 Key Metrics).

#### Intended outcome:

You will create a list of leading metrics and explain how those metrics relate to the DORA metrics.

### **Solution**

Below is a curated list of 10 potential leading metrics for Epetech, along with their connection to the DORA lagging metrics. These represent early signals that, if improved, should positively influence the four DORA outcomes.

### Leading Metrics and their Ties to DORA Metrics

1. **Percentage of builds passing on the first attempt**  
   *Ties to*: Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate  

2. **Average time for pipeline execution**  
   *Ties to*: Lead Time for Changes  

3. **Pull request review turnaround time**  
   *Ties to*: Lead Time for Changes  

4. **Rate of flaky tests detected and removed or resolved**  
   *Ties to*: Change Failure Rate, MTTR  

5. **Automated test coverage (unit + integration)**  
   *Ties to*: Change Failure Rate  

6. **Percentage of deployments using standardized templates or golden paths**  
   *Ties to*: Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate  

7. **Frequency of small batch commits/PR merges**  
   *Ties to*: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes  

8. **Mean time to detect incidents (MTTD)**  
   *Ties to*: MTTR  

9. **Environment provisioning time (self-service infrastructure readiness)**  
   *Ties to*: Lead Time for Changes, Deployment Frequency  

10. **Percentage of incidents with automated rollback or remediation**  
    *Ties to*: MTTR, Change Failure Rate
