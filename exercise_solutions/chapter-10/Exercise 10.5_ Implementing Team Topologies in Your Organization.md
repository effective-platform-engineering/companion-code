## ***Exercise 10.5: Implementing Team Topologies in Your Organization***

Objective: Restructure team interactions based on Team Topologies to improve collaboration and flow efficiency.

Here are the recommended steps for this exercise.

1. Map Current Team Structures:  
* Modeling Activity: Create organizational charts and team interaction diagrams using tools like draw.io, Visio, or Miro. Highlight communication channels and dependencies.  
* Coding Activity: Use network analysis libraries in Python (e.g., NetworkX) to model and visualize team communication patterns based on data from communication tools (e.g., Slack API).  
2. Identify Appropriate Team Types:  
* Analyze the data to determine optimal team structures.  
* Modeling Activity: Update diagrams to reflect proposed Stream-Aligned, Platform, Enabling, or Complicated-Subsystem teams.  
3. Define Interaction Modes:  
* Modeling Activity: Create sequence diagrams or flowcharts illustrating new interaction modes between teams.  
* Coding Activity: Simulate interactions using scripts or tools to model workflows (e.g., BPMN tools).  
4. Propose a Restructured Team Topology:  
* Modeling Activity: Present the new organizational structure using visual aids.  
* Coding Activity: Develop a simple application to showcase how teams interact with shared tools or platforms.  
5. Develop a Transition Plan:  
* Outline the steps and timelines  
6. Pilot the Changes:  
* Implement the new structure in a pilot area.  
* Coding Activity: Create collaborative coding projects on platforms like GitHub or GitLab to reflect new team interactions.  
7. Collect Feedback and Iterate:  
* Coding Activity: Use custom scripts to collect metrics on collaboration (e.g., pull requests and code reviews).  
* Analyze the effectiveness of the new topology and make adjustments.

The expected deliverables will be the following.

* Organizational charts of current and proposed structures.  
* Communication Patterns Analysis using visualizations from coding activities.  
* Interaction Diagrams showing new workflows.  
* Simulated Interaction Models or Applications.  
* Transition Plan with automated project management tasks.  
* Pilot Implementation Report with data-driven insights.
