## ***Exercise 10.6: Planning a Cultural Shift Towards DevOps and Collaboration***

Objective: Develop a strategic plan to initiate a cultural shift from a traditional operations model to a DevOps-oriented, collaborative culture within your organization. This includes modeling current processes and coding automation scripts to support new practices. Here are the recommended steps for this exercise.

1. Assess the Current Culture:  
   * Modeling Activity: Create process flow diagrams of your current software development lifecycle (SDLC) using tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io. Map out handoffs, bottlenecks, and feedback loops.  
   * Coding Activity: Develop scripts (e.g., using Python or Bash) to collect and analyze data on current deployment frequencies, lead times, and failure rates. Use APIs from tools like Jenkins, GitLab, or Jira to extract metrics.  
2. Define the Desired Culture:  
   * Modeling Activity: Design future-state process models that incorporate DevOps practices. Highlight differences from the current state using annotations or overlays.  
   * Coding Activity: Prototype automation scripts for CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkinsfiles, GitLab CI/CD YAML configurations, or GitHub Actions workflows.  
3. Develop a Change Management Plan:  
   * Leadership Engagement: Present your models and findings to stakeholders using visual aids.  
   * Communication Strategy: Create infographics or presentations illustrating the benefits of the cultural shift.  
   * Coding Activity: Implement the new CI/CD pipelines in a controlled environment with selected teams. Build a simple web application or use a service like Google Forms to collect anonymous feedback. Write scripts to analyze feedback data.  
4. Implement & Measure the Plan:  
   * Rollout: Implement the initiatives according to the change management plan. Use the coded automation scripts in pilot teams to demonstrate the benefits.  
   * Coding Activity: Re-run your data collection scripts to gather post-implementation metrics. Data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or D3.js can be used to compare before-and-after results.

The expected deliverables will be the following.

* Process Flow Diagrams of current and future SDLC processes.  
* Automation Scripts for CI/CD pipelines and data collection, with documentation.  
* Training Materials, including coded exercises or labs.  
* Data Analysis Reports with visualizations of before-and-after metrics.  
* Feedback Data is collected via coded tools or forms.  
* Implementation Progress Report summarizing outcomes and lessons learned.
