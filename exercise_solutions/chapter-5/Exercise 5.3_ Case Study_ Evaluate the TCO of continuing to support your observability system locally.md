***Exercise 5.3: Case Study: Evaluate the TCO of continuing to support your observability system locally***

| *In this exercise, we will revisit a specific case study related to PETech. The goal of this exercise is for you to make appropriate decisions concerning build vs. buy decisions. Your task is to pick the correct option. You are expected to write a short justification for your option of choice. Option \# 1: In this option, the platform engineering team at PETech decides to build a custom observability platform as they came to the conclusion that there are a lot of custom requirements that they could not find in an COTS solution. It involved using open-source tools such as Grafana LGTM, and Prometheus among others. They collected the requirements and decided to build an MVP to get quick feedback. Based on the user feedback, they invested in two full-time developers and a technical product manager to work on the observability platform. Their tasks included the whole lifecycle \- define the product features working with the engineering team, building, testing and deploying the products in a continuous manner and ensuring adoption of this platform for all the stakeholders within the organization Option \#2: In the second option, PETech decides to buy a third-party SaaS observability platform from Chronosphere with fluentd. This platform came with built-in scalability, cloud-native application integration, comprehensive features for about 80% of what PETech engineers needed. The benefit the platform engineering team found was that they did not need a separate team to maintain this and was able to democratize the decision making. Moreover, they were able to goto market (have all of 80% of the requirements fulfilled) within a span of 2 weeks. They did so by investing in 6 sprints of work for three developers to integrate and rollout Chronosphere with the help of the vendor recommended, third party experts. Which option would you pick? Why?*   |
