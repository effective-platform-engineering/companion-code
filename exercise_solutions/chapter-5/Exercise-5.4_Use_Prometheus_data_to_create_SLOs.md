***Exercise 5.4: Use Prometheus data to create SLOs***

In this exercise, you will first define SLOs using the data collected by Prometheus. The SLOs has to be aligned to your business needs, and sufficient justification should be provided for the SLOs 

#### Objectives:

1. Understand the importance of SLOs in a business context and how they are a crucial part of maintaining system reliability.  
2. Align technical metrics to business needs by selecting appropriate metrics from Prometheus data that reflect business objectives.  
3. Justify SLOs based on collected data by writing down the reasoning behind their chosen SLOs aligning with business context and user expectations.  
4. Use Prometheus monitoring data to formulate SLOs conduct performance analysis and metric-based decision-making.

#### Deliverables:

1. List of selected Prometheus metrics relevant to the provided business objectives.  
2. Defined SLOs (2-3) based on the chosen metrics, with specific targets (e.g., 99.9% uptime, \<200ms latency).  
3. Justification document explaining why each SLO was selected and how it supports business goals.  
4. Prometheus queries used to extract the relevant data for monitoring the SLOs.
