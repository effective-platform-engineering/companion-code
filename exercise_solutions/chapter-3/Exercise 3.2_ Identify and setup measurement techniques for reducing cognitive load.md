## ***Exercise 3.2: Identify and setup measurement techniques for reducing cognitive load***

For this exercise, we want you to create a backlog of ten potential platform capabilities that can help reduce the cognitive load.

We would like you to create a table in the following format.

| Cognitive load issue | Platform Capability that can fix the issue | How will it solve the issue? | Effort in person weeks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| …… | …….. | ……… | ……. |
| …… | …….. | ……… | ……. |

### **Solution                                                                      .**  

The solution to this exercise will be a table with ten entries similar to the example given below.

Note that column 3 is a high-level overview of how to solve the issue and would typically require a more detailed analysis to be accurate. The same thing goes for the effort in person weeks. You just need to provide a high-level swag to help set the context. In most cases, you might want to give a T-shirt size estimate for this effort.

| Cognitive load issue | Platform Capability that can fix the issue | How will it solve the issue? | Effort in person weeks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Developers often have to switch between multiple tools and environments to manage their workflows, such as coding, testing, debugging, and deploying. This frequent context switching can significantly increase cognitive load, leading to reduced productivity and increased risk of errors. | An IDE that integrates all necessary tools and environments into a single interface. Key capabilities would include: Source control management Continuous integration and deployment pipelines Built-in code analysis and testing tools Real-time collaboration features  | The solution will solve the issue across four axes. Unified Interface Seamless Integration Automation Features Collaboration and Remote Work  | Research:2 Core Features:6 Testing:4 Deployment /Enablement:2 |
