## ***Exercise 4.3: Writing an OPA Policy for Lead vs Contributor Access***

1. Write an OPA policy for an API server that allows a Team-Lead READ/WRITE/UPDATE/DELETE access to the /members endpoint and allows a Team-Contributor READ access to the /members endpoint  
2. Extra Challenge: Modify the example provided for buyer user types to work for engineering platform user types

To tackle this exercise, youâ€™ll need to remember our learnings from 3.3 with OPA and incorporate what we learned about OIDC to write a successful attribute-based policy. Think about how you might apply this policy in the real world; what identity systems might you use to authenticate your users? What authorization servers work with your identity system? For an added challenge, test your policy with real tokens; you can generate them at [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io), which is an open, industry-standard way of generating secure web tokens
